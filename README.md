# CopyPasta3

**Noun: copypasta** - _A block of text which has been copied and pasted from somewhere else._ **Etymology:** _Blend of copy + paste, likely also with a suffix like -a._

**CopyPasta3** is a small utility that enables multi-line and unlimited-length pasting of text or commands into World of Warcraft.

 

## The Successor of CopyPasta2

This addon is a **successor of CopyPasta2**. As the previous version has been discontinued, CopyPasta3 has been created to continue the legacy of this essential tool, ensuring it remains compatible with the latest expansions and patches of World of Warcraft.

If you have used _Paste_, _CopyPasta_, or _CopyPasta2_ in the past, this is the modern, maintained version you need to keep your workflows running smoothly.

_CopyPasta3 is based on the original logic by idlenexusgaming, oscarucb, and EpicChambers._

 

## Important Usage Note

CopyPasta3 is a **drop-in replacement** for its predecessors. It retains all the commands and functionality you are familiar with. To ensure the addon functions correctly and to avoid conflicts, **please disable or remove CopyPasta2 (or original Paste)** before enabling CopyPasta3.***

 

## Why use CopyPasta3?

If you've ever tried to paste a paragraph of text or a list of slash commands into WoW, you've probably noticed that newlines are stripped and anything over 255 characters is silently truncated.

**CopyPasta3 solves this problem.** It is perfect for:

*   Pasting long lists of **TomTom /way** commands.
*   Sharing long guides or snippets in chat.
*   Executing multiple slash commands at once.
*   Avoiding the frustration of the 255-character limit.

 

## Usage

1.  **Open the window:** Use the minimap icon, a set keybind, LDB, or simply type `/paste show`.
2.  **Paste your text:** Click into the box and press `Ctrl+V` (Windows) or `Cmd+V` (Mac).
3.  **Send it:** Press the **"Paste"** button. The entire content will be sent to your selected channel, one message per line. Long lines are automatically split to fit within WoW's limits.
4.  **Commands:** Use the "Default" channel to execute a list of slash commands.
5.  **Configuration:** Type `/paste config` to adjust your settings.

 

## Compatibility & Bug Reporting

CopyPasta3 is designed to be fully compatible with all modern chat addons.
